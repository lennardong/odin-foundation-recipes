        <h1>Welcome to Dad-Proof Recipes👨‍🍳</h1> 
        <p>These recipes are simple, idiot proof recipies for dads on the front line. I have perfected them over my 36 years of child/man/dad hood. They're made in under 5 minutes or less with a minimum of ingredients, so you can whip one up during a game of hide and seek or in between a trip from the toilet to the bedroom.</p>
        <p>The recipies have been battle tested with slightly-off ingredients and barely-working microwaves. They're guaranteed to satisfy in every dad situation. Excited? Without further ado.... drumroll....</p>
