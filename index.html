        <h1>Welcome to Lay-Z-Man Recipes👨‍🍳</h1> 
        <p>These recipes are simple, idiot proof recipies. I have perfected them over my 36 years of child/man/dad hood. They're made in under 5 minutes or less, so you can whip one up during a commercial break or in between a trip from the toilet to the bedroom.</p>
        <p>The  been battle tested with slightly-off ingredients, low-cash days and barely-working microwaves. Excited? Without further ado.... drumroll....</p>
